3. Lists                                                       *ctrlspace-lists*

CtrlSpace has 5 lists:

- Buffer List (<h> for Home)
- File List (<o> for Open)
- Tab List (<l> for Lists)
- Workspace List (<w>)
- Bookmark List (<b>)

To open CtrlSpace window press <C-Space>. By default Buffer List will open.
Keys <h>, <o>, <l>, <w>, <b> when pressed again toggle between current and previous
list. Similarly <backspace> works the same way.

3.1 Buffer List                                          *ctrlspace-buffer-list*

Displays buffers from:

- the current tab (Single Mode)
- visible buffers (Visible Mode <*>)
- all available buffers (All Mode <a>)

3.1.1 Single Mode                                        *ctrlspace-single-mode*

| Unicode | ASCII |
| ------- | ----- |
| `•`       | `SIN`   |

Displays only buffers related to the current tab.

3.1.2 Visible Mode                                      *ctrlspace-visible-mode*

| Unicode | ASCII |
| ------- | ----- |
| `★`       | `VIS`   |

Narrows down Single Mode to only visible buffers. For example if you have
3 files in the tab and window is vertically split (displaying two files) only
those 2 files will be displayed in the list.

3.1.3 All Mode                                              *ctrlspace-all-mode*

| Unicode | ASCII |
| ------- | ----- |
| `፨`       | `ALL`   |

Displays buffers from all tabs.

3.1.4 Zoom Mode                                            *ctrlspace-zoom-mode*

| Unicode | ASCII |
| ------- | ----- |
| `⌕`       | `*`     |

To toggle Zoom mode on press <z>. Then press <Space> to maximize buffer that is
highlighted in the list. Pressing <Space> doesn't add buffer to the current
tab – if you want to add it press <CR>. To exit Zoom mode press <z> again.


3.2 File List                                              *ctrlspace-file-list*

| Unicode | ASCII |
| ------- | ----- |
| `⊚`      | `FILE`  |


Displays all files in the project you bookmarked. To find and open a file,
press </> to toggle fuzzy-search mode.

To have the most recent list of files press <r> (refresh). If you switch
git branches don't forget to refresh the list.

Troubleshooting

If you happen to see lots of files from the outside your current project, for
example all your files from home directory, probably you set by an accident
a root mark in your home directory. To fix that, open `~/.cs_cache` and remove
bookmark entries that were added by mistake.


3.3 Tab List                                                *ctrlspace-tab-list*

| Unicode | ASCII |
| ------- | ----- |
| `○●○`     | `-+-`   |
